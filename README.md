## Projects
### Hotel Price Elasticity - Surge Detection Based Revenue Optimization Project
- Built and deployed a real-time Booking surge detection at Hotel Occupancy Date level and optimized the Hotel Margin on Dataiku platform with GKE as the backend.
- Estimated an increase in revenue by 3M GBP for 2024 Bookings.

### Flight Price Elasticity - One Way Supplement - Airline Revenue Project
- Built and deployed a real-time dynamic One Way Booking Airline pricing model on the Dataiku platform with GKE as the backend.
- Estimated an increase in revenue by 3M GBP for 2024 Bookings.

### Package Only Flights - Airline Revenue Project
- Ensembled Supervised, Unsupervised, and Pulp Optimization models to recommend package-only flights.
- Monthly batch prediction to run on Dataiku+GKE and developed a Tableau Dashboard for Business Analysis.
- Estimated an increase in Holiday Mix by 30% for identified Package only Flights.

### Customer Lifetime Value (In Development):

- Built and automated machine learning pipeline for readmission prediction models using Apache Airflow, Scikit-learn, Keras (Python3.6), and MongoDB.
- Created a real-time service using AWS Lambda and pertained ML model and exposed the API to the predefined ETL process.
- Estimated a reduction in 3% fraudulent readmission cases.

### Medicaid Retention Model:
- Built a robust machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XG-Boost) and survival model to predict the churn rate of the Medicaid population.
- Generated population retention reports based on the ML models and communicated with the business.

### Hospital Visit Classification:
- Built a machine learning model to predict the place of service based on the claim attributes to optimize the ED utilization.
- Created a Flask API and deployed the ML model on the Heroku platform as a service.
- Monitored and maintained the machine learning model and retrained periodically.

### Patient Risk Score Prediction POC:
- Built a model to predict risk scores to help the actuarial team for pricing and planning.
- Tuned hyperparameters using SKlearn's Grid Search and evaluated the performance of machine learning models using K-Fold cross-validation.
- Created the web app using the Flask Framework and deployed it on Heroku.
