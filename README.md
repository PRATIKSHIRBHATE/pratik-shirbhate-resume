## Projects
### Pne Way Supplement - Flight Price Elasticity - Airline Revenue Project
- Build and deployed a realtime dynamic One Way Booking Airline pricing model on Dataiku platform with GKE as backend.
- Estimated increase in the revenue by 3M GBP for 2022 Bookings

### Package Only Flights - Airline Revenue Project
- Ensembled Supervised, Unsupervised and Pulp Optimisation model to recommend package only flights
- Monthly batch prediction to run on Dataiku+GKE and developed a Tableau Dashboard for Business Analysis
- Estimated increase in Holiday Mix by 30% for identified Package only Flights

### Customer Life Time Value (In Development):
- Ensembled KNN, K-Means and RFM model to suggest potential high value customers for targeted marketing

### DRG Recoup:
- Develop and deploy ensembled statistical, supervised (XGBoost), unsupervised (GMM, IsolationForest, K-Prototype) model for upcoding suspect and fraud detection

### Auto Intake:
- Build and deploy automated OCR pipeline using computer vision (openCV), image segmentation & preprocessing (pillow), tesseract and NLP for Prior Authorisation scanned fax images and feed the information to databases.

### Provider Matching:
- Create a real time machine learning API service using Server-less Framework, AWS Lambda, API gateway and tensorflow/python which provides response in less than 300 ms, to improve the auto adjudication rate of claim processing system.
- Create a batch jobs automation using Apache Airflow to pull the data from SQL Servers and update the resource files on AWS S3 buckets required for API service

### Readmission Prediction:
- Build and automate machine learning pipeline for readmission predictions models using Apache Airflow, Scikit-learn, Keras (Python3.6) and MongoDB
- Create a realtime service using AWS Lambda and pertained ML model and expose the API to predefined ETL process

### Medicaid Retention Model:
- Build a robust machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XG-Boost) and survival model to predict the churn rate of the medicaid population
- Generate the population retention reports based on the ML models and communicate with the business

### Hospital Visit Classification:
- Build a machine learning model to predict the place of service based on the claim attributes to optimise the ED utilisation
- Create a Flask API and deploy the ML model on Heroku platform as a service
- Monitor and maintain the machine learning model and retrain periodically

### Patient Risk Score Prediction POC:
- Build Model to predict risk score to help actuarial team for pricing and planning
- Tune hyper-parameters using SKlearns Grid Search and evaluate performance of machine learning models using K-Fold cross validation
- Create the web app using Flask Framework and deploy on Heroku
